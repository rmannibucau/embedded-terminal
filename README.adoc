= Embedded Terminal

Goal of the project is to propose a web terminal based on server commands.
Idea is to be able to use it to debug easily an application/server.

It comes in 3 flavors:

- core jar: a dependency you can add to your war
- webapp war: a war to deploy in your container
- runner jar: an executable jar starting a web container

By default the terminal is deployed on `/terminal` and the server WebSocket endpoint on `/terminal/session`.

You can set `terminal.disabled` system property to `true` to deactivate the websocket endpoint.
You can also change the endpoint to use for the terminal setting `terminal.mapping` to another mapping, default is `/terminal`
(don't put `/*` at the end, this will be done automatically).

== Container requirement

- CDI >= 1.1
- WebSocket >= 1.0
- Servlet >= 3.0

== Overall usage

The commands are split in "modes". A mode is a set of command. For instance by default you have `jmx`
and `shell` modes. Once you selected a mode with `mode x` command you can call commands of that mode.

Few piping operators have been implemented (based on Unix4j library):

- grep
- wc
- uniq
- tail
- head
- sort
- sed
- and a specific one "normalize-slashes" (replaces \ by /)

== Extend

You can extend it (core jar case) implementing CDI "command". Just decorate a normal scoped bean with `@Command`.

@ApplicationScoped
@Command(mode = "hello", name = "world", description = "say hello")
public class Hello implements BiFunction<Session, String[], String> {
    @Override
    public String apply(final Session session, final String[] args) {
        return "hello world";
    }
}
----

- args are the options passed to the command
- session is the websocket session, you can store data in the user properties if needed
- then in the terminal just type `mode hello` then `world` and you'll get the output `hello world`.

TIP: it is recommanded to output errors instead of throwing exceptions

== Security

You can use any servlet security if your container supports it (Tomcat, TomEE, Meecrowave do for instance).
Just secure with BASIC or other the `/terminal/*` endpoints.

If you are logged when accessing the terminal the user will be retrieved and shown in the prompt.
