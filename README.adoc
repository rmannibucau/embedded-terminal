= Embedded Terminal

Goal of the project is to propose a web terminal based on server commands.
Idea is to be able to use it to debug easily an application/server.

It comes in 3 flavors:

- core jar: a dependency you can add to your war
- webapp war: a war to deploy in your container
- runner jar: an executable jar starting a web container

By default the terminal is deployed on `/terminal` and the server WebSocket endpoint on `/terminal/session`.

You can set `terminal.disabled` system property to `true` to deactivate the websocket endpoint.

== TODO

- use a servlet to setup the websocket + make the endpoint configurable (can imply to filter the front to change the url)
